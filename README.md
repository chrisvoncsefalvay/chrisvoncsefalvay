# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Chris von Csefalvay, a data scientist and computational epidemiologist currently serving as VP for Special Projects at [Starschema](https://starschema.com). You might know me from such hits as the [world's largest collection of Covid-19 data](https://github.com/starschema/COVID-19-data), the [public data set on the 2019 Samoan measles outbreak](https://github.com/chrisvoncsefalvay/samoa-measles-2019), the [public data set on the 2018 West African EBOV outbreak](https://github.com/chrisvoncsefalvay/ebola_drc) and [the first community-driven book on Julia](https://github.com/chrisvoncsefalvay/learn-julia-the-hard-way). My book, [The Computational Modeling of Infectious Disease](https://www.elsevier.com/books/computational-modeling-of-infectious-diseases/csefalvay/978-0-323-95389-4), will be available on 20 March 2023 at all good booksellers and, of course, Amazon.

You can find out more about me on [my website](https://chrisvoncsefalvay.com). I don't have Twitter or other social media (except an Instagram for pictures of my dog), but I do have [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chrisvoncsefalvay/).
