# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Chris von Csefalvay, a data scientist and computational epidemiologist currently serving as Practice Director for healthcare AI/ML at [HCLTech](https://hcltech.com). You might know me from such hits as the [world's largest collection of Covid-19 data](https://github.com/starschema/COVID-19-data), the [public data set on the 2019 Samoan measles outbreak](https://github.com/chrisvoncsefalvay/samoa-measles-2019), the [public data set on the 2018 West African EBOV outbreak](https://github.com/chrisvoncsefalvay/ebola_drc) and [the first community-driven book on Julia](https://github.com/chrisvoncsefalvay/learn-julia-the-hard-way). My book, [The Computational Modeling of Infectious Disease](https://www.elsevier.com/books/computational-modeling-of-infectious-diseases/csefalvay/978-0-323-95389-4), is now available at all good booksellers and of course Amazon.
